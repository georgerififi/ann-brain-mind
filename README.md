# ann-brain-mind
homework - projects from the class of the msc 'Brain and Mind'.
When i search something on github to help me do the exercises, i usually find something that is really helpful, but lacks something.
i wanted to make the exercises the intstructor gave us, as "complete" as possible and explanatory, in terms of visualization, as well as intuition. That's why i upload my projects here, to help at an introductory level.
