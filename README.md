# ann-brain-mind
Homework-projects from the class 'ANNs' of the msc program 'Brain and Mind', experimenting with biologically plausible neural networks.
When i search something on github to help me code, i usually find something that is really helpful, but lacks something.
I wanted to make the exercises, the intstructor gave us, as "complete" as possible and explanatory, in terms of visualization, as well as intuition. That's why i upload my projects here, to help at an introductory level.

Try the sanger.ipynb which is an implementation of the sanger's rule, and i think a nice tutorial on his paper.

If the .ipynb files don't display, try copy-paste the link of the .ipynb file in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
