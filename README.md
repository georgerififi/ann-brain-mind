# ann-brain-mind
Homework and project from the class 'artificial neural networks' of the msc program 'Brain and Mind', experimenting with biologically plausible neural networks.

Try the sanger.ipynb which is an implementation of the sanger's rule, and i think a nice tutorial on his paper.

If the .ipynb files don't display, try copy-paste the link of the .ipynb file in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
